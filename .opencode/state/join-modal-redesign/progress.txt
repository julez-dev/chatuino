# Progress Log
PRD: join-modal-redesign
Started: 2026-01-20

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidate reusable patterns here -->

---
<!-- Task logs below - APPEND ONLY -->

## Task - setup-1
- Added github.com/rmhubbert/bubbletea-overlay@v0.6.4 dependency
- Files changed: go.mod, go.sum
- **Learnings:** Dependency added successfully. Go 1.25.4 was also updated. Project builds without issues.

## Task - ui-1
- Converted join screen from full-screen to modal structure
- Files changed: ui/mainui/join.go
- **Learnings:** 
  - Modal width calculated as 60% of parent width with 40 char minimum
  - Removed fixed height constraints - modal now sized by content
  - Input width adjusted to account for modal padding (modalWidth - 4)
  - Removed full-screen spacer logic that filled to terminal height
  - View() now returns bounded modal content with padding instead of full-screen layout

## Task - ui-2
- Integrated overlay wrapper to composite join modal over active tab
- Files changed: ui/mainui/root.go, go.mod, go.sum
- **Learnings:**
  - overlay.Composite() takes strings (fg, bg, xPos, yPos, xOff, yOff) for simple compositing
  - overlay.New() requires Viewable models - use Composite for string-based rendering
  - Background renders current tab or splash screen when no tabs exist
  - Existing resize handling in handleResize() already updates both modal and tabs
  - Dependency needed to be re-added (was missing from go.mod)
